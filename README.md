# App-Landing-Page

This was a final project at my bootcamp SheCodes. We were supposed to choose something we are passionate about and create a landing page for it.
I am passionate about travelling and I had already done a UX case study on a travel app at the UX bootcamp, so I have decided to create a landing page to promote this app.

First I started with structuring my html into logical segments:

-menu section
-introduction section
-about app section

Then I  focused on creating an appealing css to create travel vibe by using colors that resemble beach, sea, forest, relaxation.

Finally I have also added a javascript to the main button on the page - to create a little interaction with the user and ask him some questions.
I have used prompts and alerts in combination with "if functions" and also an "innerHTML function" to finalize the result.
